#Making changes in `client3.py` - getDataPoint Method
# In this method, you'll have to make modifications to compute the right stock price. This means you have to change how
# `price` is computed by using the formula: (bid_price+ask_price) / 2.
# YOU DO NOT NEED TO CHANGE the return value as that is representational of the entire data point. You should end up
# with something like:
